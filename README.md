## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App #1: Notion
This is my go to app for all organization and tracking goals.
I like that it is a clean slate and you are able to customize pages in both design and functionality in order to meet your needs.
Able to insert blocks of code and choose programming languages is a great feature especially with being a software engineering student.

App #2: Duolingo
Ability to make learning languages fun and the illustrations are really well done.
I like the monthly challenges they do to encourage you to practice everyday.


App #3: Libby
Being able to reserve and rent books onto my kindle from the public library.
Having access to audiobooks as well and being able to play them through app on CarPlay while driving on roadtrips or running errands.

App #4: Goodreads
Able to track progress of book while reading it based on the page # or percentage of completion
Being able to keep inventory of books while also connecting with friends to see what they are currently reading.
