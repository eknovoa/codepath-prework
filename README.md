Submitted by: **Erin Novoa**

**Color Picker** is an app that allows you to randomly change the background color of the app with just the click of a button.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

Additional Features Added On:

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App #1: Notion
This is my go to app for all organization and tracking goals.
- I like that it is a clean slate and you are able to customize pages in both design and functionality in order to meet your needs.
- Being able to insert blocks of code and choose the desired programming language is a great feature especially with being a software engineering student.

App #2: Duolingo
- Ability to make learning languages fun and the illustrations are really well done.
- I like the monthly challenges they do to encourage you to practice everyday.


App #3: Libby
- Being able to reserve and rent books onto my kindle from the public library.
- Having access to audiobooks as well and being able to play them through app on CarPlay while driving on roadtrips or running errands.

App #4: Goodreads
- Able to track progress of book while reading it based on the page # or percentage of completion
- Being able to keep inventory of books while also connecting with friends to see what they are currently reading.

- [x] Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement.

I know there are already a lot of financial tracking apps out there, but I have started designing one for fun. I think it would be really cool to build it out and implement data visualization as well as machine learning to suggest to users ways to save money based on their current spending habits, etc. 

## Notes

Initial challenge was just figuring out the functionality to change the label text color between black and white, but I was able to figure it out pretty quickly.
